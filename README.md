Azulahub README
Overview
Welcome to the project! This application is divided into two main parts: the backend (located in the back folder) and the frontend (located in the front folder). The backend serves as the core functionality provider, handling data management, authentication, and other server-side operations. Meanwhile, the frontend is responsible for providing the user interface and interacting with the backend to deliver a seamless user experience.

Technologies Used
Cloudinary: Used for image and video management, providing a cloud-based solution for storing and manipulating media files.
React: A popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces, utilized in the frontend to create dynamic and interactive components.
JSON Web Token (JWT): Employed for authentication purposes, allowing secure transmission of information between the frontend and backend.
Prisma: A modern database toolkit used for data access and management, enabling easy integration with various databases.
Redis: A fast, in-memory data structure store utilized for caching frequently accessed data, enhancing performance.
Getting Started
To start the application, follow these steps:

Navigate to the back directory.

Run the following command to start the backend server:

npm run dev
Open another terminal window/tab and navigate to the front directory.

Run the following command to start the frontend server:

npm run dev
With these steps completed, you should have both the backend and frontend servers up and running, allowing you to access the application locally.

Additional Notes
Make sure to configure your Cloudinary credentials and any other necessary environment variables for proper functionality.
You may need to set up a database connection for Prisma, depending on your specific requirements and configurations.
Redis can be configured for caching to optimize performance, especially for frequently accessed data.
Feel free to explore the codebase and customize the application according to your needs and preferences.
